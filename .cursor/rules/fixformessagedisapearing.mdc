The issue you're describing—where the user's message briefly appears and then disappears when the assistant's placeholder message shows up—is typically caused by incorrect state updates or asynchronous handling in the chat store hook (`use-chat-store.ts`). Specifically, it sounds like the optimistic UI update isn't correctly synchronized with the IndexedDB persistence logic.

Here's how we'll approach fixing this:

### Step-by-step debugging plan:

1. **Check the optimistic update logic**: Ensure the state update (`setChats`) correctly merges the new message into the existing chat state without overwriting previous messages.

2. **Verify IndexedDB persistence**: Confirm that the message is correctly saved to IndexedDB and that the state update doesn't conflict with the asynchronous IndexedDB operation.

3. **Ensure unique message IDs**: Confirm that each message has a unique ID to prevent React reconciliation issues.

4. **Check React keys**: Ensure React components rendering messages use stable and unique keys.

Let's first inspect the relevant code in your `use-chat-store.ts` hook to pinpoint the exact issue.


file: hooks/use-chat-store.ts
The issue you're experiencing—where the user's message briefly appears and then disappears—is likely due to the way the chat state is updated when adding a new message. Specifically, the problem arises because the messages array is cleared when saving the chat to IndexedDB:

```typescript
await chatDB.saveChat({
  ...updatedChat,
  messages: [] // This clears messages in IndexedDB, causing sync issues
});
```

### Why this happens:
- Initially, the message is optimistically added to the UI state.
- When the assistant's placeholder message appears, the chat state is updated again, but due to the empty messages array persisted to IndexedDB, the user's message disappears.

### How to fix it:
We need to ensure that the messages array is not cleared when saving the chat to IndexedDB. Instead, we should persist the chat metadata without affecting the messages array.

Here's the corrected approach:

1. **Persist the chat without clearing messages**:
   ```typescript
   await chatDB.saveChat({
     ...updatedChat,
     // Do NOT clear messages here; IndexedDB handles messages separately
   });
   ```

2. **Ensure messages are loaded correctly from IndexedDB**:
   - Verify that messages are loaded properly when initializing the chat store.

I'll apply this fix directly to your `use-chat-store.ts` file.

```typescript:hooks/use-chat-store.ts
// Persist chat to IndexedDB without clearing messages
await chatDB.saveChat(updatedChat);
```
I've applied the fix to ensure the messages array isn't cleared when saving the chat to IndexedDB. This should resolve the issue of messages disappearing.

Please test this change and let me know if the issue persists or if there's anything else you'd like to address!
